# Feature Investigation Report

## 1. Context

**Goal of the feature**: Create a complete iOS app workflow for launching and managing multiple Claude agents running in Fly.io containers, with real-time terminal streaming communication - all without requiring CLI tools.

**Key Requirements**:
- Launch Fly machines with custom claude-agent container via REST API
- Multi-session terminal management with background persistence
- Seamless tab switching between machine management and terminal interaction
- Complete programmatic deployment (no `flyctl` CLI dependency)

## 2. What Went Well

### ‚úÖ **Multi-Session Architecture**
- Successfully implemented `SessionManager` for managing multiple persistent WebSocket connections
- `AppStateManager` properly handles machine selection and state synchronization
- Background session persistence working - switching tabs doesn't terminate connections
- Clean separation between Agents tab (machine management) and Terminal tab (interaction)

### ‚úÖ **Fly.io API Integration** 
- Complete REST API client (`FlyAPIClient`) with proper error handling and logging
- Machine launching works successfully - containers are created and run
- App creation API integration functional
- Proper authentication with bearer tokens

### ‚úÖ **Container Infrastructure**
- Custom claude-agent container built and published to GHCR
- FastAPI server with WebSocket streaming endpoints
- Dockerfile and container deployment pipeline working
- Authentication and basic agent management endpoints implemented

### ‚úÖ **iOS Architecture**
- Clean 3-tab architecture (Agents, Terminal, Settings)
- SwiftTerm integration for terminal UI
- Comprehensive test suite (11 tests passing)
- Proper memory management with weak references and async handling

### ‚úÖ **Developer Experience**
- Excellent logging system with categorized output
- Comprehensive Makefile with testing commands
- Good documentation in CLAUDE.md
- Feature pod architecture for code organization

## 3. What Didn't Go Well

### ‚ùå **Hostname Resolution Issues**
- Machines launch successfully but WebSocket connections fail
- Error: "A server with the specified hostname could not be found" for `claudeagents.fly.dev`
- Fly.io machines don't automatically create public hostnames
- Private IPs (`fdaa:25:ba4c:a7b:...`) not accessible from outside Fly network

### ‚ùå **App Deployment Complexity**
- Distinction between "creating an app" vs "deploying an app" unclear
- Current API calls create machines but don't establish public routing
- Programmatic deployment approach needs refinement
- Status "created" vs "started" timing issues

### ‚ùå **Connection Timing**
- Race conditions between machine creation and hostname availability
- Hard-coded delays (5-15 seconds) not reliable
- Need better health checking before connection attempts

### ‚ùå **Terminal Input Handling**
- TerminalViewDelegate implementation commented out due to protocol conformance issues
- No bidirectional input/output working yet
- SwiftTerm integration incomplete

## 4. Root Cause Analysis

### **Primary Issue: Fly.io Architecture Misunderstanding**

The core problem is a misunderstanding of how Fly.io exposes services publicly:

1. **Creating a machine** ‚â† **Creating a public service**
2. Machines need **explicit service configuration** and **app deployment** to get public hostnames
3. The approach of "launch machine ‚Üí connect to hostname" skips the deployment step

### **Secondary Issues**:
- **API Design**: Fly's API has separate concerns for machines vs deployments vs services
- **Networking**: Private IPs require different connection approach or Fly network membership  
- **State Management**: Complex async state between app creation, deployment, machine launch, and connection

## 5. Lessons Learned

### **Process**
- Need clearer understanding of target platform architecture before implementation
- Should have prototyped network connectivity separately from full app
- Incremental testing of each API endpoint would have caught hostname issues earlier

### **Tooling** 
- Excellent logging system was crucial for debugging
- Make commands streamlined development workflow
- iOS Simulator testing worked well for non-network components

### **Communication**
- Clear documentation in CLAUDE.md helped maintain context
- Good separation of concerns made debugging easier
- Feature investigation process (this document) will help continuation

## 6. Recommendations

### **Immediate Next Steps (Priority Order)**

1. **üîß Fix Hostname Resolution**
   ```bash
   # Test manually first:
   flyctl apps create claudeagents
   flyctl deploy --app claudeagents --image ghcr.io/aplucche/cc_ios-claude-agent:latest
   # Then verify: curl https://claudeagents.fly.dev/
   ```

2. **üîç Investigate Fly Service Configuration**
   - Research correct Fly.io API endpoints for service deployment
   - Understand difference between machines API and apps API
   - May need `PUT /v1/apps/{app_name}/services` or similar

3. **‚ö° Implement Proper Health Checking**
   - Replace hard-coded delays with hostname resolution checks
   - Add HTTP health check before WebSocket connection
   - Implement exponential backoff for connection retries

4. **üéπ Complete Terminal Input Integration**
   - Research SwiftTerm.TerminalViewDelegate required methods
   - Implement bidirectional input/output 
   - Test with simple echo commands first

### **Technical Debt to Address**

- Remove debug logging from production code
- Add error recovery for failed connections
- Implement proper session cleanup on app termination
- Add integration tests for full deployment pipeline

### **Future Enhancements**

- Machine health monitoring and auto-restart
- Multiple region deployment
- Session sharing/collaboration features
- Enhanced security with app-specific tokens

### **Alternative Approaches to Consider**

1. **Use Fly.io GraphQL API** instead of REST for deployments
2. **Pre-deploy base app** and only launch machines dynamically  
3. **Use Fly 6PN networking** for direct machine-to-machine communication
4. **Implement fallback to direct IP connection** for development

---

**Status**: 90% complete architecture, blocked on hostname resolution. Should be resolvable with 1-2 focused sessions on Fly deployment API research.
